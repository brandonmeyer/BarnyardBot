# BarnyardBot
CS 175 group project using Malmo

download BarnyardBot.py into the python examples directory and run 'python BarnyardBot.py' in the console with Minecraft open

type '!RATIO m:r:b' in chat to change the current resource ratio. m = milk, r = red wool, b = blue wool
for example, '!RATIO 1:0:0' tells the agent to collect milk and no red or blue wool

TestVersions contains versions of the project that were used for experimenting. ratios.txt is required in the same directory for some of them.
