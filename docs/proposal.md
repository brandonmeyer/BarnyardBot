## Summary
Gathering resources from farm animals in *Minecraft* can be tedious. When a player needs buckets of milk or stacks of wool, they have to walk to the animal pen and manually gather all of the resources. This is time consuming, and prevents the player from quickly accessing these items for projects like baking, healing status effects, creating colorful builds, or making beds to sleep through the night. Animal-AI will fix this problem by automatically gathering these resources for the player. It will take the agent's vision as input and output the correct action to harvest the given animal's resources. For example, seeing a cow promts the agent to use a bucket and seeing a sheep prompts the agent to use shears. The goal of this project is to automate animal resource gathering and give the player more time to explore their creativity in *Minecraft*.
