## Project Summary
Gathering resources from cows and sheep in *Minecraft* can be tedious. When a player needs bulk buckets of milk or stacks of wool, they have to walk to the animal pen and manually gather all of the resources. If a player only wants one color of wool, they have to chase after the sheep in their pen and find the right colors. With cooldowns, the player could also find themself waiting for more milk or for wool to grow back. This is time consuming, and prevents the player from quickly accessing these items for projects like baking, healing status effects, creating colorful builds, or making beds to sleep through the night. Animal-AI fixes this problem by navigating throughout an animal pen and automatically gathering these resources for the player. It takes the agent's current target as input and output the correct action to harvest the current animal's resources. For example, seeing a cow promts the agent to use a bucket and seeing a sheep prompts the agent to use shears. BarynardBot will only harvest resources that the player specifies. If the agent is looking at the wrong animal, the wrong color sheep, or no animal at all, it will walk around the pen until it finds what it its looking for. Since BarnyardBot can run at all times, the player doesn't need to wait for animal cooldowns. Barnyard bot will harvest resources whenever it can. The goal of this project is to use *Malmo* and *RLlib* for animal resource gathering automation, and give the player more free time to explore their creativity in *Minecraft*.
