Brandon:
Set up GitHub repository, created GitHub site, scheduled proposal appointment, helped with idea brainstorming, wrote proposal during team call, wrote majority of status and final reports, filmed and took pictures for status and final report videos, recorded voice overs for status and final report videos, edited status and final report videos, created base project with Malmo and python for experimentation, experimented with implementing ratios through text, experimented with ratios through chat, tested different RLlib algorithms to determine best one for the project, ran project for many hours to test learning capabilities and collect data.

Jason:
Helped with idea brainstorming, helped come up with proposal content, read and suggested edits for proposal, status report, and final report, created graphs for status report from test data, recorded voice overs for status and final report videos, experimented with base project and tested adjustments to reinforcement learning, experimented with implementing ratios through blocks, worked on ratio reward correction on complex ratios, experimented with tuning hyperparameters, tested Malmo observations, ran project for many hours to test learning capabilities and collect data.

Adarsh:
Helped with idea brainstorming, helped come up with proposal content, read and suggested edits for proposal, status report, and final report, recorded voice overs for status and final report videos, experimented with base project and tested adjustments to reinforcement learning, experimented with implementing ratios through chat, worked on ratio reward correction, worked on tuning multiple hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc) by running the project for many hours to test learning capabilities and collect data then manually tuning each parameter based on the data.
